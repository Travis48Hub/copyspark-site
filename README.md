# Hi, I’m Travis 👋

I’m a student and self-taught developer passionate about creating tools and services that help people bring their ideas to life. My strength lies in learning quickly, experimenting with new technologies, and turning ideas into working projects.

## 🚀 Current Projects

**CopySpark**  
A service site for creators and marketers, starting with copywriting support and expanding into more creator-focused tools.

**Web-to-Mobile App (Work in Progress)**  
I’m developing a web application that will later evolve into a mobile app. My focus is on design, usability, and providing real value to users.

### Design & Creativity  
Before coding, I studied graphic design and digital illustration, which helps me approach projects with a creative eye for detail. 
I create digital tools, AI-powered copy, and art to make life easier for creators + small businesses 💡 | Buy me a coffee ☕: buymeacoffee.com/artdesignza or
